# Residual-Attention-Aided-U-net-GAN-and-Multi-instance-Multi-label-Classifier
This is the code of Paper ''Residual_Attention-Aided_U-Net_GAN_and_Multi Instance Multilabel Classifier for Automatic Waveform Recognition of Overlapping LPI Radar Signals''

This code comprises of two parts, one is the super-resolution part, which is used by a Residual Attention aided GAN structure, where the generator is a U-net, the other is the multi-instance multi-label classifier, where spatial and channel attention mechanism are exploited.

The algorithm code is available, and hope it will help.
